Week 1

Team formed.
We created github group accounts, and choosed project 1 and second topic as our task.
I read materials followed by given project's introduction(links). 
Next week we plan to have a group meeting to exchange thoughts and make a draft for proposal.


Week2

This week we planed to have a meeting for starting the project and preparing for proposal.
On Monday's meeting, We discussed possible structures and available techniques. Then we proposed some candidates of epics.
The obstacles(mainly about proposal, discussed but unsoved): 
                                      1, how deep can the user's questions ask to the agent about course content?
                                      2, will database be provided
                                      3, do we need to support Collaborative Learning
The first and sencond problems we didn't get helps from lab hours. And we knew we do not need achieve Collaborative Learning by the tutor said.
Next period we plan to do some research to work out a clear structure, as well as learn related knowledge and techniques.
Meanwhile, complete the proposal by next Wednesday.

We had an extra meeting on Friday. Before that, I have read documentation of DialogFlow and related materials. Then shared
what I learned to my group members on the meeting. We decided to use Node.JS, instead of flask. We also decided to deploy our
agent on more platforms, such as facebook messenger, google asistant, benefitting from powerful features of dialogflow. And I
proposed a plan that solves how can we match user's intent with course content. But still had problem on it. Finaly we discuss
and assigned tasks about proposal to each group member.

I have completed the second half part of technical depth. We plan to integrate our works on next Monday.



Week3

The third week I planned to read papers provided in course website, so that we could finally determine a strategy that 
can find a related part from extracted course content, w.r.t users questions. And I intended to construct a text preprosessing
model by this week, preprocessing the raw course data.

In the lab hours, tutor suggested us to modify our proposal. I made a new diagram that illustrates how the agent works more
specifically. The new diagram is more clear and detailed in presenting work procedure. By Friday, we intergrated our works on
proposal then submitted it.

After my research, I was inspired by two essays: 'MOOC-O-BOT: Using Cognitive Technologies to Extend Knowledge Support in
MOOCs' and 'Text Retrieval by Term Co-occurrences in a Query-based Vector Space'. Therefore, I decided to introduce a IR model
as the core function, which could rank the content chunks. The chunk with highest score will be presented to users. Besides, I
plan to introduce a learning factor adjusted by users feedback, with which the matching acucuracy could be improved.

In the last two days of this week, I completed the preprocessing model then tested it.

Next week I plan to construct the Keywords Extraction model.



Week4

This week my task is to construct the Keywords Extraction model and test it.

On the weekly meeting we clarified our respective tasks in current stage. I told my group members the interfaces of the 
APIs (backend) and the form the data needed, so we can make sure that different components can work together successfully.

I encountered a issue that the keyword extracting threshold is difficult to determine. I am going to adjust it when we have
more data.

Next week I plan to build a tentative IR model and explore a method that uses intent matching of dialogflow in a brilliant
way, improving the performance of the IR model. 



Week5

1. What was planned?
Construct IR_model and do some research on how to introduce a learning factor that makes agent more intelligent. 

2. What was finished?
Both of two tasks planned.

3. What were main issues?
I met a problem that how to store previously constructed data and learning factor. I planned to store them using 
database system, however in practice it slowed system's speed too much.

4. What was not finished?
No.

5. What is planned for next period?
Complete learning module and intergrate current works together with my group members.



Week6

1. What was planned?
Complete learning module and intergrate current works together with my group members.

2. What was finished?
We intergrated our current works together and it could work successfully.

3. What were main issues?
I am really suffering from dry eye and blepharitis so I cannot use computer for a long time according to doctor's advice.
I did not complete learning module but I read some materials about it.

4. What was not finished?
Learning module.

5. What is planned for next period?
Continue to complete learning module and make a draft of report for backend.


Week7

1. What was planned?
Implement the learning module and write a draft of report for backend.

2. What was finished?
Both of these two planned tasks.

3. What were main issues?
Still cannot use computer for a long time. I wrote code for draft on paper and then typed them.

4. What was not finished?
No.

5. What is planned for next period?
Our new and full database is going to be ready for use next week. I am going to connect it to the backend and test
our agent on new data.


Week8

1. What was planned?
I am going to connect database to the backend and test our agent on new data.

2. What was finished?
connect to database, test with whole data, write part of report

3. What were main issues?
when testing, i found some problems with new data, I ask sophia to modify our data(she has completed it this week)
and I also did some modifications od backend to fit new data

4. What was not finished?
No.

5. What is planned for next period?
prepare for presention, test system and fix it

Week9

1. What was planned?
prepare for presention, test system and fix it

2. What was finished?
fix some small issues to backend so that user can have a good conversation experience.
make the diagrams for report and presentation
test system and fix problem.

3. What were main issues?
we put our system into the web server. however, sometimes due to the connection delay our system 
may have errors. especially in reading files. so I add lots of exception handlings to solve it.

4. What was not finished?
No.

5. What is planned for next period?
prepare for presentation. continue to test system

Week10

1. What was planned?
prepare for presentation. continue to test system

2. What was finished?
we fix some issues during the ysytem test and do much exercise for presentation

3. What were main issues?
no

4. What was not finished?
No.

5. What is planned for next period?
complete report
