Week 1 
20/02/2019
Group formed. I created the Trello & GitHub accounts and joined our team. We chose our team's name which is Fire Balloon.
We also decided to achieve project 1 and the topic that is student-tutor support system. 
Besides, we have booked a cats room that we can have a discuss about our proposal draft next week.

Week 2
25/02/2019
We booked a cats room and had a meeting about our proposal including the software tools and the achieving goals. 
I also wrote our notes on the whiteboard. However, there are some questions we need to check with tutor.
For example, when will we get the database that supported by professor and what is the format of the given data?
We also confused about how to train the data by using machine learing.
Overall, we made a framework of our project.
27/02/2019
In the lab, we discussed with tutor and then divided the work of our proposal. I was assigned to write background and aim.
Therefore, I planed to read more essays and learn more about conversational agents.
01/03/2019
We had an extra meeting on Friday because we were worried about our proposal was a little behind comparing with other groups.
This meeting really did a big progress of our proposal. Firstly, Hal shared his experiences about learning dialogflow.
Hal also wrote a guide for us in Chinese. Secondly, we adjusted the framework of our project and decided to use node.js
instead of flask. Besides, Angelo has already written some epics and we discussed. 
I also read the template of the proposal which is given by our professor. 
After that, Tianyu and I read the documents of dialogflow together.

Week 3
04/03/2019
We planned to finish our proposal's draft on Monday and I integrated all team partners' work in one file. 
We will make some modification and discuss it on Wednesday before the lab.
06/03Ôºè2019
In this lab, tutor talked a lot with us and we need to do a lot of modification. For my part, firstly, I must add the
references for the background. Secondly, I need to write the aim more specificly. I plan to finish these work before Friday. 
We also should add a picture of our framework for our project, this work was assigned to Hal.
08/03/2019
This day is the last day of the submission for our proposal, I sent my updated parts to Hal and Angelo did the last
integration of our proposal. He really did a great work.

Week 4
12/03/2019
Aftering submitting our proposal, we had a meeting for the next step of our project. 
We assigned some specific tasks to everyone for achieving our project. 
My mission is to choose a specific course and learn to use the web scraper to extract all the content of this course. 
After that, I should learn how to construct a corpus. I plan to do more research of these parts and send the corpus to Hal
as soon as I can.
13/03/2019
We all have some progress in our own parts. For me, I chose the course COMP9444 and started to extract the content.

Week 5
19/03/2019
We had a meeting for the next day's demo of our project. We talked about our schedules of our own parts and what should we 
do for the following tasks. In my parts, my next step is to classify the content in the corpus for Hal's training data.
20/03/2019
In the lab time, we know that we are far from what we want to achieve. My job is to work with the data and make the data 
more classifiable and clear as I can.

Week 6
26/03/2019
Group meeting before lab, everyone did a lot since last week. Now, it is the time for me to create a database and upload 
all the data to the database.
27/03/2019
In the lab, tutor told us we need to do more course as we can, it is not enough for only one course. Therefore, we need 
more courses, Angelo and I decided to use the COMP9414 and COMP1531. For my part, I will extract all the content of these
two courses.

Week 7
03/04/2019
In the lab, tutor told me that the way I extract data does not make sense, I need to change my way of extracting data.
By the way, we need to start to write the report draft from this week.
05/04/2019
I tried many ways to extract data from a pdf file to a txt file. Finally, I find the package "pdfminer" is really good!
I read a lot of documents of "pdfminer", I figure out how it works on its objects and I finished my part successfully.

Week 8
10/04/2019
In the lab, tutor told us that we had a lot need to be improved. I find the format of some special symbols in my part is
not very good. This week, I am going to fix this problem and I will start to write our final report. We decided to write
our own part seperately and I integrated the whole draft.

Week 9
17/04/2019
In this lab, I showed our draft for final report to our tutor and tutor told us that we should improve the part about the 
differences between our proposal and our achievement. Besides, for my part, I added the pageid to every answer for the 
consideration of user friendly.

Week 9
19/04/2019
We had a meeting about our final presentation and some improvement of our project. In this meeting, I was assigned to do the 
live demo part for our final presentation. There are really a lot work to prepare, like how to choose the questions and how
to express them well.

Week 10
22/04/2019
This is our second last meeting for our project. We simulated many times about our presentation and modified a lot to perfect
our presentation. I tried to speak fast to reduce the time of live demo.
