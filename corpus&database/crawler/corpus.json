Neurons have specialized extensions called dendrites and axons Dendrites bring information to the cell body, while axons take information away from the cell body. 2. The axon of one neuron can connect to the dendrite of another neuron through an electrochemical junction called a synapse. 3. Most neurons have only one axon, but the number of dendrites can vary widely: (1). Unipolar and Bipolar neurons have only one dendrite (2).

Axons can vary in length from less than a millimetre to more than a metre (motor neurons) 3. Long axons are sometimes surrounded by a myelinated sheath, which prevents the electrical signal from dispersing, and allows it to travel faster (up to 100 m/s)."}{"Artist Critic Coevolution": "1. electrical pulse reaches the endbulb and causes the release of neurotransmitter molecules from little packets (vesicles) through the synaptic membrane 2. transmitter then diffuses through the synaptic cleft to the other side 3. when the neurotransmitter reaches the post-synaptic membrane, it causes a change in polarisation of the membrane 4. the change in potential can be excitatiory (moving the potential towards the threshold) or inhibitory (moving it away from the threshold)"}{"Meta-Game of Learning": "1. human brain has 100 billion neurons with an average of 10,000 synapses each 2. latency is about 3-6 milliseconds 3. therefore, at most a few hundred \u201csteps\u201d in any mental computation, but massively parallel"}
