1.Read PDF File
2.Extract Data
Use the library named 'pdfminer' which need the environment to be 'python 2.7'. By reading a lot of documents of this 
library, there are many different structures of objects. In my task, I need to focus on those text objects and ignore the 
pages which only have some pictures on it. Therefore, I need to distinguish the figure object between the text object.
After that, i need to find out these texts, which are titles, which are answers. That means I need to use the difference
between them and I choose to use the font size. Also by using the library, I can get the different font sizes and then i
can seperate and store the titles and answers.
3.Process Data
There are some pages which have the same content but different pictures. However, it is meaningless to store all the same 
content. That's why i need to process data and only leave those meaningful data. Besides, some content may also have the 
sub-title, in this case, I need to find out the symbol of the sub-title and then seperate the title and the answer. Last 
but not the least, some content may have some tips and i also need to give the serial number to them. By the way, for the 
conveience to the students, i also add the pageid in that pdf file to every answer.
4.Store Data
Because i need to upload all the data to the database, then i need to store the data in a json file.
5.Upload to Database
We deside to use the mongodb, then we need to use the pymongo library to contact with the database.
