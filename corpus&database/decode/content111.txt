1. Lecture Friday 10-1 in John Clancy Auditorium 2. Friday tutorials begin in Week 1 3. Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu tutorials begin in Week 2 4. Prolog Labs (optional) start Friday of Week 1 and continue until Week 5
1. AI, Tasks, Agents & Prolog: What is AI? Classifying Tasks Agent Types Prolog Programming 2. Solving Problems by Search: Path Search  Heuristic Path Search  Games  Constraint Satisfaction 3. Logic & Uncertainty  Logical Agents  First Order Logic Uncertainty 4. Learning  Learning and Decision Trees  Perceptrons & Neural Networks  Reinforcement Learning
1. sign up to OpenLearning (through Moodle) 2. work through this weeks Learning Activities 3. set up and log into your CSE account 4. start working through the Prolog Exercises
Prolog Labs are not compulsory. You can attend at any time(s) that suit you. Lab Consultants will be there to help you if you have questions.
1. very useful for AI and search 2. good for you to see an example of a non-imperative language 3. logic programming languages like Prolog have recently had a resurgence of popularity in the computing industry

Assessment will consist of: Assignments 40% Written Exam 60% In order to pass the course, you must score 1. at least 16/40 for the assignments 2. at least 24/60 for the exam 3. a combined mark of at least 50/100
The assignments may, for example, involve writing a program to: 1. enable an agent to act in a simulated environment 2. solve a problem using search techniques 3. play a game 4. apply a machine learning algorithm
1. ALL work submitted for assessment must be your own work 2. for an individual assignment, collaborative work in the form of “think tanking” is encouraged, but students are not allowed to derive code together as a group during such discussions 3. in the case of a group assignment, code must not be obtained from outside the group 4. plagiarism detection software may be used on submitted work 5.

1. proposed by Alan Turing in 1950 2. a human interrogates/converses with the computer via a teletype 3. the aim is for the computer to imitate a human well enough to fool the human interrogator
Turing thought a computer would pass this test by end of the 20th century. The Loebner Prize (Turing test) competition is held each year. The Total Turing Test allows physical objects to be passed to the machines as well as characters via the teletype.
